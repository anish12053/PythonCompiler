Hi I am Anish Kumar.
Final year student from IIIT Vadodara.

I have made a pyhton compiler using Flutter for frontend and python for backend

To run the code you must have flutter installed along with python and flask

for frontend
run : flutter run 

for backend
run : python3 app.py

This project is capable of running as well as identifies the error also.
this can interact with user for input and produce the output for same also.

For any query:
